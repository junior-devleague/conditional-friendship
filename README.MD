# Conditional Friendship

## Objective

* Students will learn how to communicate and think conditionally.
* Students will learn how to gather data and use the data in code.
* Students will learn how to write control flow statements.

## Rules

1.  Students must find another student that meets the exercise criteria.
2.  Students can only match up with another student once.
3.  Students will have to think about how they are going to write their conditional statements. What operators should they use, how are they going to make the comparisons, etc.
4.  Students should have the freedom to think about how they are going to approach the activity.
    - Options:
        * Students can gather all their data first then start coding.
        * Students can gather data and code one exercise at a time, then move onto the next exercise.

### Exercises

**_\*HINT :_** You will need to create variables in order to compare values.
Example:

```
# Find someone who likes ice cream

melLikesIceCream = True

if (melLikesIceCream == True):
  print('mel and I are friends because she likes ice cream')
else:
  print('No friends. No problems. More ice-cream.')
```
